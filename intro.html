            You & your friends, Mary and Kodi, decide to go camping in City Park. Its winter time, and in New Orleans this is the best time of year to sleep outside, before the humidity & mosquitos arrive with the warm weather. Camp fires are the best for telling ghost stories and eating s'mores. 
            
            You approach a sign in City Park: No camping or overnights stays
            <ul>
                <li>Ignore sign and explore</li>
                <li> home and do backyard camping </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Find a small unnamed island -> need a raft, get a small inflatable pool raft. 
            Find a forest trail -> get caught by cops, chased off

Intro:
My friends, Mary, Lily, Kodi, Alex & I decided to go urban camping in City Park. It was winter time, and in New Orleans there are only a couple of weeks of cold weather, so we wanted to take advantage of it. Summer camping in the humidity & with the mosquitos is awful. We were going to bring some smores, and tell ghost stories. Now camping isn't allowed in city park, so we needed to find a remote locale far off from view to pitch our tents and build our fires. 
Overnight visits or strictly prohibited, can't even park your car overnight on the grounds.

find someones cellphone, its dead. Use a battery pack on it?

Cultist -> summon a swamp dragon

Moss island
I don't see any other islands on google maps, although it can be an uncharted island. One you wouldn't find on google maps because its too small. Only known to the locals who forge out and explore the more wild parts of the park

The boat is gone

Yeah, its not really important thats its actually real, but I do like the plausibility of it might being real
I like the idea of an island, this way their boat can go missing
and then they have no escape
    
Small island left wild and untamed. No roads or bridges. So we take a small inflatable raft. We just bloat up with a bike tire pump.

too deep in the park, the cell sites don't work.

I think when they get on the island and make camp, they may find a discharged  smartphone that they can decide to charge up and turn on.


Oh yeah that's good. A portable battery charger. And they have a little bit of time when they get it and start charging it until they can look at it
Warning them that the monster will take their boat but it's too late


yeah, exactly

find bones and other remenants of a fire, strange markings etched into the trees.
