        <h1>Go Home</h1>
        <p>
            Deciding to follow the posted rules, you leave the park and go home. You stream a small fireplace on your tv. You invite your friends overs and microwave some s'mores. But they aren't the same as the ones put over a real fire.  You tell some scary stories. But given the pedestrian atmosphere of your living room, even with the lights off, and it dark outside. There's just no real sense of isolation or dread that you get out in the woods. Your friends aren't impressed either, and suggest this would be a better experience outdoors, the s'mores and wood and weather is wasted staying in.

            Deciding to follow the posted rules, you and your friends leave the park and return home. You setup a small fire in your backyard, in a firepit and enjoy s'mores and tell some scary stories. But they aren't all that scary given the pedestrian atmosphere of the residential backyard, street lights, city noises of dogs and cars. There's just no sense of isolation you get in the woods. Eventually you just go inside and watch some Morgus the Magnificent instead.
